# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
	CheckMate is a group that is made up of diverse, brilliant people and enthusiastic 
	programmers. Collaboration between group members and productive communication with the 
	tutor are critical factors for the teamwork. While Roehampton’s Students Code of Conduct 
	is providing the official framework for our group [Roehampton's Students Code of Conduct] (https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/globalassets/documents/corporate-information/policies/student-code-of-conduct-july-2018.pdf), 
	our group’s Code of Conduct defines 
	the minimum requirements of professional behaviour we expect from each member of the group.

## Our pledge
	We vow to act socially responsible and in an honourable manner. 
	All our procedures and activities must abide by all relevant international, national 
	and local laws and contractual terms.

## Standards
 	All members of the group need to realize that behaving socially responsible and in
	an honourable manner is essential for our group’s identity and they are expected to conduct 
	themselves as respectful citizens of both the group/university and the local community.
	
	
	Examples of conduct that promotes a constructive environment:

	* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward group members
	* Being respectful of differing opinions ,viewpoints and experiences
	* Giving and accepting constructive feedback 
	* Accepting responsibilities and apologizing to those affected by your mistakes/decisions
	* Focusing on what is best not for ourselves, but for the whole group
	
	The group considers the form of inappropriate conduct that are set out below to constitute 
	misconduct that is likely to lead to disciplinary action. The list shouldn't be considered exhaustive.

	Examples of conduct that may lead to disciplinary action:
	
	* Public or private harassment
	* Plagiarism / Cheating
	* Missing work deadlines
	* Failing to comply with any group's rule, regulation or policy


## Enforcement responsibilities
	
	The group has the authority to establish procedures and impose disciplinary action on a student 
	that fail to abide or repeatedly/intentionally fail to abide by the standards of Code of Conduct.
	The Code of Conduct encourages group's members to raise allegations with Group Leader of members 
	misconduct,esspecialy where it may be possible to address these promtly.  
	If any member want to appeal a decision issued by the Discipline Comittee, they need to do it in 
	writing within 10 working days after the decision was issued.
	For more serious and complex allegationsm, Group Leader will send a report containg all the info 
	to the class Tutor.
	He will take responsability of applying current Code of Conduct/Roehampton's Student Code of Conduct.
		
## Sanctions	
	Where a member is found to have breached the Code of Conduct, the group may take the following actions:
		* Report to class tutor
		* Suspension of the group member until the matter is settled
		* Writing an apology letter to the wronged party
		

## Scope
	
	The purpose of this code of conduct is to explain what conduct is expected of all members 
	and the consequences of unethical behaviour.
	This helps reduce the likelihood that they'll undertake unethical actions, which protects the 
	group.
	We all depend on each other, so be patient and courteous. This is the only way we will 
	thrive as a team and produce the best product/app as a group. Your decisions will affect the 
	group, the clients, and the product. So before taking any decision, be considerate and think 
	about the others and the possible consequences of your decisions.
