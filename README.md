# Coursework

![](.git_assets/logo.png "Logo")

In this coursework we are tasked with creating an application for the smooth and efficient
operation of a business. We will work on the project as a Scrum team and therefore need to 
adopt both design methods (user stories, use cases) and project management methods (Agile, Kanban). 
We will also need to become familiar with the tools of a typical software development team 
(Visual Studio, Git, Docker) and some of the difficult human and technical issues around 
collaborating on and continuous improvement of online applications. Fundamentally, we aim to 
develop a CRUD application. A CRUD application is effectively a front-end to a database, 
providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a web site to a database on a server.
