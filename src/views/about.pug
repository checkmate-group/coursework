                 | This group of talented programmers are tasked with creating an application 
                 | for the smooth and efficient operation of a business.
                 | We will work on the project as a Scrum team and therefore need to 
                 | adopt both design methods (user stories, use cases) and project management
                 | methods (Agile, Kanban). We will also need to become familiar with the tools 
                 | of a typical software development team (Visual Studio, Git, Docker) and 
                 | some of the difficult human and technical issues around collaborating on and 
                 | continuous improvement of online applications. Fundamentally, we aim to develop
                 | a CRUD application. A CRUD application is effectively a front-end to a database, 
                 | providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a web site 
                 | to a database on a server.

                p(class="fs-5 mb-4")
                | He needs a web App to is easy to use, user-friendly and accurate, to help him develop his prediction model

                | Scenario: 
                p(class="fs-5 mb-4")
                | Dr. Sobhan is developing a system that will be able to predict where and when the next 
                | epidemy will emerge based on the population of a specific area. His model will take many things into account,
                | such as, how many people live in the city, how many people live in the countryside etc.
                | In order to make his job easier and faster, he needs quick access to information about population in different area of the Earth.
                | He needs a Web App connected to a database so that he can show all the results to potential clients of his model and 
                | also in the future he might want to link the Database to his system.
