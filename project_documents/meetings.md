## 24/01/22 – First meeting (1 Hour 25 minutes)
The first meeting was an introductory session for the group. During the meeting we discussed various topics such as the name for the group and getting

During this meeting, we decided on the base principles of the Code of Conduct. [@archeris32](https://github.com/archeris32) agrees to draft the base of the 
Code of Conduct. Everyone else contributed with different ideas about what the Code of Conduct should have. [@KezzyRk](https://github.com/KezzyRk) shows us a 
basic logo idea from the internet that we all liked. Furthermore, [@Nero-DevOps](https://github.com/Nero-DevOps) gave [@ZOulhadj](https://github.com/ZOulhadj)
the idea to crop the king icon from the banner and to have that be the group icon on GitHub.

## 31/01/22 – Initial project requirements (2 hours 4 minutes)
Our main priority for this meeting was to ensure we were all on the same page regarding who oversees what and how the team will work together. [@ZOulhadj] has 
significant experience with GitHub, so during this meeting he shares some knowledge with us about how the project should be set up including commits, branches,
merges as well as the GitHub website.

We also decide on who's going to do what for this sprint:
* [@ZOulhadj](https://github.com/ZOulhadj) - GitHub Set-Up

## 02/02/22 – Progress update (35 minutes)
The third meeting was quite a short one due to the extensive meeting that we had the previous week. Over the course of this meeting, we simply cross-checked 
with each other to ensure that we were on the right track. Furthermore, this gave us an opportunity to ask each other questions as well as to provide some help.
