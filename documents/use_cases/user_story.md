# User story 

In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders like client, user, manager, or development team.

User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context. [reference - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)

Remember that user stories take the form:
As a < user role >, I can < activity > so that < business value >.
